**Recon and Discovery (Continued) - Fixed**
This is an update for Recon and Discovery to fix pretty much every aspect of mod so that it's no longer completely broken.

The mod design (how quests work for example, it's not with the quest system) is all pre-royalty, so don't expect it to hook into the vanilla quest system. Also, since this is pre-royalty, all mention of psychic in this post refers to the pawn trait psychically sensitive, not pawns with the psi-abilities. Since there's no new functionality, but up until now almost every part of it was broken anyway, here's a list of general features (mostly the same as the mod page, but structures a bit more clearly and with some extra info):
 * Quests:
   * Osiris Casket Quest - Can occur if you have a pawn that is psychically sensitive in your colony
   * Seraphites Quest - If you have a luciferium addicted pawn and a visitor comes around, you might hear rumors of an Ancient Lab that might have a luciferium cure. If you want to go there, you'll need to take some chemfuel and steel or a portable generator to get power
   * Tremors - You can get random tremors that cause mountain roofs to collapse if you don't go destroy a broken generator
   * Radiation - Your colony might suffer from radiation weather until you go plant psychoid in a certain area
   * Crashed ship - If you've got a comms console or a pawn watching the sky, you might get news that a ship has crashed near by. There's a 40% chance of there being alive pawns who need medical aid. If that happens, you need to wait on the map until they're all capable of walking. If you do that, there's a chance of getting a holo-emitter that increases with every pawn you saved. There's also a small chance that they'll set themselves up as a new Outlander Civil faction
 * Random Events
   * Peace Talks - You might get a request to improve relations with an enemy faction
   * Muffalo Herds - When caravanning, you might spot a heard of muffalo. Visiting it, there's a 5% chance of half of those muffalo turning manhunter at some point while you're on the map. You'll only get warning if one of your colonists on the map is psychic
   * Trade Fair - You'll get news that a trade fair is going, if you head there, there'll be a trader from each faction on the map that is not hostile to you
 * Animals
   * Devillo - Muffalo that have devilstrand wool
   * Nitralopes - A blue chemfueled boomalope that will explode if not milked
 * Items
   * Teleporters - Pulls a pawn **from** another map to it's location, used to capture enemies or resuce pawns. If you're raided by mechaniods, there's a chance of this spawning on an extra scyther per teleporter you've got on your map
   * Stargate - Lets you search for other Stargate locations on the map to travel to instantly. Can also cause a raid to spawn from your star gate
   * Osiris Casket - Ressurector Machine
   * War Idol - Lets one psychic pawn pray at the idol to give your other psychic pawns a combat boost while the prayer continues. Also lets you sacrifice an animal marked for slaughter at the alter to kill all psychic enemies on the map. Found in Ancient Military complexes
   * Weather Idol - Set a pawn to "pray" there to collect "mana", which you can use to clear weather effects, summon rain or call a flashstorm that only attacks enemies on your map. Mana accumulates faster with pawns who are psychically sensitive.
   * Holo Emitter - Rare reward from the medical emergency of the crashed ship. Essentially let's you transfer a recently dead pawns corpse into it to create an undying "hologram" of that pawn

What I'd like tested:
 * General testing to see what breaks
 * How buggy holograms are in general use - I think they're limited in the area they can go, does this end up causing the holograms to go into a loop when you use them normally? They can't die, does this make them OP in raids when it comes to distracting enemies?
 * Do the event frequencies need adjusting - Are they too frequent? Not frequent enough? How frequent do you think they should be?
 * Weather Idol - Is the rate at which the "mana" accumulates sufficient?
 * Insane muffalo herds - I think the herds of muffalo that spawn are pretty large, is sending 50% of them manhunter too many? Should it be a smaller number? Should they become manhunter in waves (so 10% in one go, then another 10% a short bit later and so on)
 * Loot - I get the feeling the loot in the areas that this mod spawns might be a little bit sparse. Do you think they're alright? Is it too stingy? Should it be the same number, but higher quality?

I've naturally done some light testing with dev mode while fixing everything to try and catch bugs that I can find and make sure that doing things the normal way doesn't cause errors, but I'd like to get this mod thoroughly tested by a few people and get feedback on balancing and loot. I don't have much or any experience with balancing mods before so any feedback on that is appreciated. I'm not particularly looking for feedback on whether this mod feels like it integrated into newer Rimworld systems like the quests system at this point of time, mostly because I'm planning on doing a v2 upgrade for this mod after I finish just making this mod work
